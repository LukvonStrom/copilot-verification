## Changed Copilot System Prompt for shorter files

```
{"role": "user", "content": "I have the following code in the selection:\n```python\n# FILEPATH: /Users/lukasfruntke/Postman/test.py\n# BEGIN: ed8c6549bwf9\nimport os\nimport os\n\ncurrent_path = os.getcwd()\nprint(\"Current path:\", current_path)\n# END: ed8c6549bwf9\n```"}, 
```

```
Only change the code inside of the selection, delimited by markers '# BEGIN: ed8c6549bwf9' and '# END: ed8c6549bwf9'. The code block with the suggested changes should also contain the markers.
